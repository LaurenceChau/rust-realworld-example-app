A native TDS (MSSQL) 7.4 driver for Rust

The new async rewrite is in progress in the master now.  
Documentation pending.
Support for versions below 7.4 (to 7.2 so that everything >= SQL Server 2008 works) planned.

## Old State (v0.1)
The old state can be found [in the "old" branch (click me)](https://github.com/steffengy/tiberius/tree/old)
